# Overview

Example-API is an example of how to build a clean coded API that is all about making things simpler and safer when you're using websites that handle your personal details and your money. It focuses on two key areas:

Keeping User Logins Safe: It ensures that when someone logs into a website, their identity is verified securely. This prevents unauthorized access and protects personal information.

Tracking Bitcoin Prices: It keeps an eye on how much Bitcoin is worth, updating this information in real time. This is really handy for anyone who needs to know the latest Bitcoin prices for their financial decisions.

Features
```
    User Authentication: Allows users to sign up and manage their authentication status.
    Bitcoin Price Management: Provides functionalities to update and retrieve the latest Bitcoin prices.
    Middleware for User Verification: Includes middleware to verify if a user exists before proceeding with requests.
    Error Handling: Implements a middleware for handling errors throughout the API.
```


# Installation

```
yarn install
```

## Usage

Start the server with:

```
yarn start
```


This will launch the API server on http://localhost:8080.
Endpoints
```

    POST /signup - Handles user signup.
    POST /bitcoin/price - Updates the Bitcoin price.
    GET /bitcoin - Retrieves the current Bitcoin information.
```

# Configuration

Dependencies

    Express.js for routing and middleware.
    Body-parser for parsing incoming request bodies.
    Custom services and models to handle business logic and data representation.

## Models

The API uses models such as Bitcoin, which encapsulates the behavior and properties of the Bitcoin price, including methods to update and fetch the latest price.
